# Aserto Management Package

This package exposes the controller factory that can create handlers used in the aserto runtime resolvers of an [edge authorizer](https://docs.aserto.com/docs/edge-authorizers/overview) to receive commands from the central [control plane](https://docs.aserto.com/docs/overview/control-plane).
